    <h1>A Web-Development Journey</h1>
        <p>After watching some YouTube Videos, I thought to my self: 
            It has never been so easy for me to learn coding. On the one hand,
            regarding my skill-level and general understanding of how
            programming works. On the other hand regarding the infinite
            number of high quality learning material you can access 
            <strong>for free</strong>.
        </p>
    <h2>First Steps</h2>
        <p>I started out learning some basic Python algorithms on <a href="https://www.py4e.com/">Python for Everybody</a>. Nothing too
            new for me, because most of the content was part of my Programming 1
            and Programming 2 course <em>during my studies</em>. 
        </p>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>While learning Python became a little bit boring, I started working myself through
            <strong>"The Odin Project"</strong>. The first lessons were <em>extremely</em> interesting
            and I truly understood what the Internet is and the abstract concept of "the Internet"
            became a logical one to me. 
        </p>
    <h2>What's happening now</h2>
        <p>Right now I'm practising some HTML basics. While I practise, I'm curious
            about how to put Websites on a server so everyone can visit them. I will continue
            with learning more HTML stuff and then head over to CSS and JavaScript. I can't await it.

    <h2>About</h2>
        <p>You can click <a href="pages/about.html">here</a> to get to the About Page.</p>

        <p>You can find it on the About page, too.</p>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>You can make unordered and ordered lists</p>
        <h3>Unordered:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ordered:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
        </ol>
